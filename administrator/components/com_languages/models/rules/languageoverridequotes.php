/**
 * Form rule to block quote characters in language override text for non-Super Users (CVE-2026-48954).
 *
 * Override text is rendered unescaped almost everywhere in Joomla core and third-party extensions via
 * JText::_(), including inside hardcoded HTML attributes (e.g. title="<?php echo JText::_('KEY'); ?>").
 * A quote character in an override value breaks out of that attribute and injects a new one, bypassing
 * InputFilter entirely because InputFilter only sanitises HTML tags found *inside* the override text —
 * it has nothing to inspect when the payload is a bare quote with no angle brackets. Rejecting quotes at
 * the point of entry (for anyone who isn't already fully trusted) closes the whole class of sink, since
 * auditing every echo of JText::_() across core and every installed extension is not feasible.
 *
 * @since  3.15.0
